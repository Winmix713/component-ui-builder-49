Looking at the error, I can see the issue is with the ViteImagemin plugin configuration. The error "Missing valid plugins option" indicates that the plugin configuration syntax is incorrect.

I can see the issue! The current vite.config.ts file in your project is the original, simple version, but you're trying to run it with the more complex configuration that includes the ViteImagemin plugin and other plugins that aren't installed.

The error is happening because:

Missing dependencies: The configuration you shared includes @vheemstra/vite-plugin-imagemin and rollup-plugin-visualizer, but these aren't installed in your package.json

Plugin configuration syntax: The ViteImagemin plugin configuration syntax appears to be incorrect for the version you're trying to use

Missing imports: Your actual vite.config.ts doesn't have the imports for these additional plugins

Analysis of the problem:
Looking at your current vite.config.ts, it's the basic configuration without the additional plugins. The error suggests you're trying to use a modified version that includes:

@vheemstra/vite-plugin-imagemin
rollup-plugin-visualizer
Advanced build optimization settings
Solutions:
To fix this issue, we have several options:

Revert to working configuration (Recommended for immediate fix):

Keep the current simple vite.config.ts that's working
Remove any additional plugin configurations causing the error
Install missing dependencies and fix configuration:

Add the missing packages: @vheemstra/vite-plugin-imagemin and rollup-plugin-visualizer
Fix the ViteImagemin configuration syntax
Update the configuration properly
Gradual enhancement:

Start with the working configuration
Add one plugin at a time to ensure each works
Test after each addition
The immediate fix is to make sure you're using the working vite.config.ts that's currently in your project, not the enhanced version that has missing dependencies.

Would you like me to help you either:

Fix the current configuration to get the dev server running immediately, or
Properly set up the enhanced configuration with all the optimization plugins?
